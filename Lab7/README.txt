Instructions

For this lab you need to create a base class and two derived classes from the base class.
(You may not use the example from class or the examples in the book.)
Do not make your classes too complicated, but yet make them interesting.

You must include the following features:

1.   In the base class:

           a.  some private class variables
           b.  some protected class variables
           c.  operator<<() for the base class
           d.  constructor for the base class (of course)
           e.  at least two methods for the base class




2.   in the derived classes

         a.  some private class variables other than what is inherited
         b.  operator<<() for the derived classes
         c.  constructors for the derived class (uses initialization list)
         d.  some methods for the derived class that are not inherited
         e.  one method in each class that overrides a base method



3.   a main program that tests and shows off all the different options,
it must be well explained.
